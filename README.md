# haskell-class
Chapter notes and exercises from our weekly Haskell class. These notes roughly follow the print version of Miran Lipovaƒça's excellent book [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). Please note that the chapters in the online version are off by one from the print version (e.g. Higher Order Functions is ch 6 rather that ch 5).
